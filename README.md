# Portfolio-V1
This is my first portfolio showing off my work! 

I will be putting my previous and current projects up on this portfolio. 

The purpose of this page is just to serve as a simple, yet informative page about me as well as my experience. I primarily am using this portfolio as a stepping stone when it comes to developing a visually appealing and effective portfolio page.
I will always be developing my skills and creating. Always learning, always growing. This is first of many portfolios, with the goal being a portfolio that is appreciated and sought after by employers and companies.
